This folder present an example of use of xepr_link to record a resonator profile:
	- resonator_profile.py runs the experiment with nutation.exp and nutation.def and saves the data in nutation_freq.txt and nutation_ydata.txt.
	- res_data_treatment.py runs the data treatment and saves the data in resonator_profile_f_211210.txt and resonator_profile_H_f_211210.txt.
