p2   = 200     ; shaped pump pulse
p3   = 12      ; ELDOR pulse width
p4   = 300     ; shaped second pulse

pg   = 56      ; Integrator Gate Width
d0   = 350     ; Detection Trigger offset time

d1   = 200     ; tau1
d3   = 100     ; T
d7   = 224     ; d7 longer than sx*d30-(d1-d3)
d11  = 13000   
d9   = 0       ; DAF (Delay After Flash) delay pulse sequence until
                        ; after external event (eg. laser pulse)
d30  = 2       ; 1st time scale increment
m    = 12      ; number of tau1's to average
q    = 12      ; numbe r of tau2's to average
d31  = 8       ; time step for T increments



a    = 1024    ; (RESERVED) number of transient averages (TRANS)
               ; if greater than 1024, a must be a multiple of 1024
h    = 200     ; (CONVENTION) number of shots per point (INTG and SPT)
n    = 64      ; (CONVENTION) number of sweeps to accumulate

srt  = 150 * srtu ; (RESERVED) SRT - Shot Repetition Time (srtu=1.02 us)


; end of AWG variables

b    = 1       ;
c    = 1       ; number of scans within a slice
r    = 1       ;
s    = 1       ;
t    = 1       ;

w    = 800     ; (RESERVED) Split point of sweeps (ns)


dx   = 0       ; (RESERVED) 1st time scale starting value

; Note:
;        Variables Marked 'RESERVED' = variable may be used for other times,
;               however only this variable can change
;               the indicated parameter.
;               eg. only 'a' will change the number of
;               transients averaged in SpecJet
